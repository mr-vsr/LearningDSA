# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The codebase is organized as follows:

## Data Structures

### Arrays: 
Implementation of array data structure with basic operations.

### Linked Lists: 
Implementation of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

### Stacks: 
Implementation of a stack data structure using arrays and linked lists.

### Queues: 
Implementation of queue data structure using arrays and linked lists, including priority queues.

### Trees: 
Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.

### Graphs: 
Implementation of graph data structure with graph traversal algorithms.



## Algorithms

### Brute Force: 
Straightforward approach to problem-solving by considering all possible solutions and selecting the best one.

### Divide and Conquer: 
Breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them recursively, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

### Decrease and Conquer: 
Reducing a problem to a smaller instance of the same problem and solving it iteratively or recursively.

### Transform and Conquer: 
Transforming a problem into a different representation or form, which makes it easier to solve.

### Greedy Technique: 
Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum solution.

### Dynamic Programming: 
Breaking a complex problem into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing its solution for future use.

### Recursion: 
Solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem until a base case is reached.

### Backtracking: 
Systematically searching through all possible solutions to find the correct one.
